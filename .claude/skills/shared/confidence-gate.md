# Confidence Gate

Shared by all pipeline skills (grill-me, to-prd, to-issues, tdd). Run
this immediately before the skill's completion banner.

## Process

1. State a confidence percentage (0–100%) that there's enough information
   to proceed without the developer needing to correct this later.
2. If 95% or higher — proceed to the completion banner.
3. If under 95% — ask ONE targeted question narrowing the single biggest
   remaining gap. Never stack questions. Re-assess confidence after the
   answer and repeat from step 1.

## Carve-out — don't ask what you can look up

Skip asking if the gap is already answered by an existing artifact:
CLAUDE.md, a completed PRD or issue file, a discovery.md finding, or an
established repo convention. Cite the source instead of asking.

Don't manufacture questions to hit a quota — if the task is already fully
specified (e.g. "fix this failing assertion," "run the tests"), there is no
gap to close. The gate exists to catch real ambiguity, not to pad the
interview.

## Cap — 5 extra rounds

Mirrors the cap in `4-tdd/visual-verification.md` and `visual-check/SKILL.md`.
If still under 95% after 5 rounds of extra questions, stop looping:

- State the remaining assumptions explicitly, tagged `ASSUMED`.
- Log them into the PRD/issue's "Open Questions" section (or the tdd
  completion report, if no PRD/issue is in scope for that assumption).
- Proceed rather than blocking indefinitely — the developer can correct an
  assumption faster at review than by being stuck in an endless interview.
